## 1. Shelter-to-Zone Connectivity Analysis
**Problem Statement**   
In a disaster scenario, shelters must be connected to disaster zones through optimal routes to minimize evacuation times and maximize the speed of resource allocation. These connections form a weighted graph where nodes represent shelters and zones, and edges represent transportation routes with weights denoting distances or travel times. The goal is to find the shortest path between every pair of nodes.  

**Key Aspects**
- Shortest path between all pairs of nodes.
- Identification of critical routes to prioritize resource allocation.

**Algorithm Applied**<br>
  Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: It efficiently computes shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph, even with negative weights (provided there are no negative weight cycles). This ensures a global view of connectivity for all shelters and zones simultaneously.

**Time Complexity**
  O(V^3), where V is the number of shelters and disaster zones (nodes).

## 2. Task Scheduling for Rescue Operations
**Problem Statement**
Rescue operations must be prioritized based on urgency (e.g., severity of the situation) and deadlines (e.g., time by which the task must be completed). Tasks are modeled as a list of objects with attributes like urgency and deadlines, requiring sorting to maximize operational efficiency.

**Key Aspects** 
- A sorted task list based on predefined criteria (e.g., earliest deadline first, highest urgency first).
- Efficient scheduling to maximize the number of successful operations.

**Algorithm Applied**  
Merge Sort: Merge Sort is a stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that ensures consistent results and optimal time complexity for sorting large datasets. The output is a sorted list of tasks based on the selected priority criterion (e.g., ascending deadlines or descending urgency).

**Time Complexity**  
O(nlogn), where n is the number of tasks.

## 3. Flood Path Prediction
**Problem Statement**  
Predict the spread of floodwaters across low-lying areas to enable timely evacuations. The terrain and water flow are represented as a graph where nodes are geographical regions, and edges represent potential water flow paths. The objective is to simulate the time-dependent progression of floodwaters starting from initial flood sources.

**Key Aspects**  
- A timeline of flood progression in affected regions.
- Early identification of high-risk areas for timely evacuation and resource deployment.

**Algorithm Applied**  
Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS is ideal for level-by-level traversal in graphs, making it suitable for modeling the gradual spread of floodwaters across connected areas. The output is a list of flooded regions with their respective flooding times, allowing predictions of which areas will be affected next.

**Time Complexity**  
O(V+E), where V is the number of regions (nodes) and E is the number of connections (edges).

## Conclusion
These algorithms address critical aspects of a disaster response system, ensuring optimal connectivity, task prioritization, and predictive capabilities. While the time complexities vary based on the scenario, their integration ensures an efficient and effective response to emergencies.
